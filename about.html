        <p>
            Youmy Productions is a production company based in San Marcos, California
            founded by Alex Chang in May 2022. Alex has been inspired by art all his
            life and more recently has taken a keen interest in the film-making
            arts world where he hopes to continue to build a career in film-making.
            The company's vision and mission is to work with young aspiring 
            film-makers, writers, actors/actresses, crew-members, community leaders,
            and businesses to create exciting, provocative and new content that
            challenges those who watch our films. Alex will be attending the University
            of CA Berkeley in the fall of 2022, with plans to go into film-making
            studies, business and marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a newly formed, student-led organization, we are open to all 
            channels of opportunities. Our initial plans are to start our work in
            the non-profit, community-based settings. Our main content concentration
            at this time will be in creative short films. We hope to continue to
            grow and build relationships, recruit talent, and increase our production
            staff as well as our connections for continued future growth and ongoing
            audience outreach.
